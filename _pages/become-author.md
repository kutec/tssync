Initially <strong><a title="LinkedIn Profile" href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/kutec" target="_blank">Kushal Jayswal</a></strong> has started <a title="TeckStack.com" href="http://teckstack.com" target="_blank">TeckStack </a>as a personal technology and news blog. But letter he got many requests from other blog authors for contribution and finally TeckStack is now open for other authors Â too.

Currently we have two authors and very few articles as both of us very busy with projects and clients. But we have few plans that will come out with the time.

We are planning for various categories. Currently we are limited to technology, coding, web design, web development, seo and interest.

If you want to contribute, you may send us a<span style="font-size: medium;"> <strong><a title="contact@teckstack.com" href="mailto:contact@teckstack.com" target="_blank">mail</a></strong></span> us with some demo articles that you have written for blogs, magazine, etc.
