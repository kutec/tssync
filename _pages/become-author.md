<a href="http://teckstack.com">TeckStack</a> encourages people for sharing their knowledge. There are multiple ways you can contribute to us.
<h3>Guest &amp; Sponsored Post</h3>
We are open for <strong>guest</strong> and <strong>sponsored</strong> posts.  We have a dedicated page to <a href="http://teckstack.com/become-author/submit-post">submit a new post</a> to reduce the mail stack and efforts.

<strong>Sponsored post will be paid</strong> and we only accept sponsored posts relevant to one of our categories. Our minimum rate to publish a sponsored post is $50 (USD).
<h3>Become a Proud Author</h3>
TeckStack has enough traffic. So being a developer, if you want to publish your knowledge in form of various articles, you are most welcome! You can establish your visibility globally by publishing your posts with us.

We also have payment options for regular contributors. But it really depends, we do not pay to each author (we are still very small to pay to everyone, yes but of course, we are planning in this direction).
<h4><strong>Few Plus Factors, becoming author:</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Visibility to the community</li>
	<li>Dedicated Author/Profile Page</li>
	<li>Conversation with like-minded people though comments</li>
</ul>
