<blockquote>As per psychology - <strong><em>people forgets a name easily but not a picture associated within</em></strong>. And hence big companies spend a lot for a <span style="text-decoration: underline">conceptual logo design</span>. There are many agencies working only for a "Brand Development". And as a web designer, clients expect us to manage their brand well and sharp, in all resolution.</blockquote>
This article will focus on responsive behavior for main branding element.
