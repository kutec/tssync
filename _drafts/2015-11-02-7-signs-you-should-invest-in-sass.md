<blockquote>Writing CSS is an easy task. But doing the same in a proper manner, which can be understood by any developer in a team that is more important.</blockquote>
Before you start a project with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, you should understand that how it can help for CSS authoring. Sass stands for “<strong>Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets</strong>” and people use Sass won’t disagree with the statement. Today major projects demand for media query and branding options and from the experience I found Sass as one of the best solution to improve the way, we write CSS.

For big projects, writing and managing pure CSS becomes hectic sometimes. To overcome such a situation, we now have pre-processors. (As this article is going to focus on Sass, we will be concentrating only on Sass and not <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a> or <a href="https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/" target="_blank">Stylus</a>.)

<a href="http://teckstack.com/how-to-configure-sass-for-html-projects" target="_blank">Configuring Sass</a> is not too tough. You can go manually or can choose from set of tools mentioned on the [site]. I use [Skout] for HTML projects and [WP-SCSS] for WordPress. Liferay has `@compass` built-in, so one can directly start writing Sass with importing of the `@compass` at the top of the `. scss` file.
