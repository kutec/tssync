Since, you are reading this post, it can be anticipated that you might already be running a website on WP or planning to do so, while ensuring a responsive solution.
<h3>Why Responsive?</h3>
In this mobile age, the web is receiving a colossal mobile traffic, which is incessantly surpassing the desktop traffic. Thus, it is more than imperative for a website to efficiently run on mobile devices as well. But, the proliferation of mobile creates the biggest challenge that makes it an arduous job for a web designer and developer. Fortunately, the talented professionals have unveiled a brilliant solution to this issue with a responsive design approach.

However, one needs not to feel jittery about creating a responsive WP site, as there are several ways to generate a responsive WP website. In this post, I will enlighten a few of the most preferred methods to develop a responsive WP website. This will help you streamline a suitable solution and create a ravishing WordPress website that can run seamlessly on any device.

Let's ponder into the most commendable ways to develop a responsive WP website.

<h2>Make Your Current Theme Responsive</h2>
It might be a case that you want to make your current theme run smoothly and seamlessly on various devices. If it is so, follow the below mentioned steps and accomplish the job.

In order to make a responsive design, you will first need to transform your code from pixels to percentage.
<h3>Step 1: Organize Your Media Queries</h3>
Every WordPress theme has its own stylesheet (CSS), which is implemented on the desktop as well as mobile versions. Simply define the maximum width along with a particular set of styles by using the following line of code.
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">@media screen and (max-width: 480px)</pre>
With this code, you can specify a distinct set of styles for 480 pixels screen. There are various screen sizes that can be used as required, including 780 pixels, 1024 pixels, etc.
<h3>Step 2: Deal Proficiently With Images</h3>
If your theme possesses huge images that are actually spilling out of their containers, it can cause an issue. However, you can combat this issue by adding the below mentioned chunk of code in your CSS.
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">body img {
    max-width: 100%;
}
</pre>
<h3>Step 3: Implementing Suitable Font Size</h3>
It is imperative to make your text adjust its size according to the targeted screen. For this reason the responsive typography makes a lot of sense. One must ensure that the text on his website is legible and easily readable on all screen sizes.

You can efficiently adjust the text on the basis of the targeted screen real estate by implementing this little code.
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">body {
    font-size: 40%;
    line-height: 1.5em;
}</pre>
<h3>Step 4: Don't Forget The Other UI Elements</h3>
There are several other elements that must be changed to create a responsive layout. It comprises the width of your WP website, the content, header, footer and widgets.
<h3>Step 5: Spruce Up The Navigation</h3>
The navigation must be a breeze if you really want to deliver a great UX. While making your layout responsive, you can think of elements that can leverage your site navigation and enhance the overall experience of your users. By doing so, you can increase the scope of users returning back to your website, and thus win their loyalty.

For instance, you may choose to implement a drop down box rather than integrating a navigation bar, or you can let your navigation menu expand the option on a complete page, and thus, generate the look and feel of a mobile application. In fact, you can also incorporate a suitable plugin to proficiently manage the navigation menu.</li>
