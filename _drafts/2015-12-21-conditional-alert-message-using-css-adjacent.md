There are number of ways we can apply style to an element. <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Selectors/combinators/adjacent" target="_blank">CSS adjacent</a> is one of the CSS selector. It allows to target next sibling element.

This article will focus on a small tip to show <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conditional alert message with CSS Adjacent selector</span>, which I came across during on <a href="http://ifiuse.com" target="_blank">ifiuse</a> project. Ifiuse built on AngularJS but you do not need to be expert to understand the example in terms of CSS adjacent.
