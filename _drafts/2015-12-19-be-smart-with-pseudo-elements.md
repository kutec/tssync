CSS holds the power to apply the styles on the HTML elements. These elements are part of the DOM tree structure. We can directly apply styles to the DOM elements but in CSS, we have various selectors to maintain consistent styling across the application.

Set of<strong> </strong>the<strong> Pseudo element</strong> is one of the CSS selector, which is actually not a part of DOM tree. Such element open the doors for extra stylings.
