CSS holds the power to apply the styles on the HTML elements. These elements are part of the DOM tree structure. We can directly apply styles to the DOM elements but in CSS, we have various selectors to maintain consistent styling across the application.

Set of<strong> </strong>the<strong> Pseudo element</strong> is one of the CSS selector, which is actually not a part of DOM tree. Such elements opens the doors for extra stylings for current DOM element.

Let's say, if you have a advertisement section for a blog and you want to add Heading  , where for the advertisement section, you want a text to recognize the section by adding heading before the advertisement block starts.
