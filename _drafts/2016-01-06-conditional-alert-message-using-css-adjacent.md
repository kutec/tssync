<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many CSS selectors we can apply style through and</span> <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Selectors/combinators/adjacent" target="_blank">CSS adjacent</a> is one of them. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Using adjacent selector, we can target very next element at the same level of element sequence.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I recently worked on an AngularJS project with a friend, where on-page </span><b>content search</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the main feature. Also user can filter data based on his preference. Below I am attaching a draw version of the UI for more clarity.</span>

This article will focus on a small tip to show <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conditional alert message with CSS Adjacent selector</span>, which I came across during on <a href="http://ifiuse.com" target="_blank">ifiuse</a> project. Ifiuse built on AngularJS but you do not need to be expert to understand the example in terms of CSS adjacent.
