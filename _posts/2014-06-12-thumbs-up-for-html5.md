<blockquote>The <a title="HTML5- Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank">HTML5 was introduced in 2012</a> (draft) and highly recommended by professionals. It has number of new and meaningful tags those make sense for SEO in a positive way. Further it has new feature for offline data storage which allows us to create small mobile apps easily. There are many frameworks available developed on HTML5. The popular examples are <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and <a title="Foundation" href="http://zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a>.</blockquote>
I am sure if you are a web designer then cannot stop yourself adopting HTML5. But developers sticks to the older stuffs unless and until not forced for the newer one<em>(this is general approach of developers and I am not against them)</em>.

&nbsp;

Below are some points we should give Thumbs Up for HTML5.
<h2>For the Future</h2>
Though HTML5 is not fully adopted but it is adoption for the future. Many developers have already started using it and others are planning to use the next year. It is demand for the future.

We can see number of popular products like <a title="Kendo UI" href="http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui" target="_blank">Kendo UI</a>, <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, <a title="PhoneGap" href="http://phonegap.com/" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a>, etc. built using HTML as a markup base. And the numbers of users are increasing day-to-day.

I know HTML5 is not supported in old IE browsers like <strong>IE6</strong>, <strong>IE7</strong> and <strong>IE8</strong>. But the research is showing that hardly <em><a title="IE6 Countdown" href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/ie6countdown" target="_blank">4.2% users of IE6</a></em> and <em><a title="IE7 Countdown" href="http://theie7countdown.com" target="_blank">1% users of IE7</a></em> exist in the entire world.

Moreover if we talk about<strong> IE8</strong> browser – there are numbers of hacks available which helps to create HTML5 tags as native one - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/">http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv</a>. I am using HTML5 for my clients and approach them for a progressive enhancement and they do not disagree because on the latest browsers HTML5 is smoother than silk.

<h2>Adobe Flash in Danger</h2>

When I saw a <a title="Occupy Flash" href="http://occupyflash.org/" target="_blank">dedicated website</a> saying “<strong>NO TO FLASH PLAYER</strong>”, I was totally surprised! The website is fighting for uninstalling flash player from their desktop browsers and instead giving support to modern development standards like HTML5 video players.

I really like the concept because I don't like to install <a title="Adobe Flash Player" href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Adobe Flash Player</a> every time when want to play Youtube video. It was very annoying experience for all of us and that is why I appreciate the fight against Flash Player in browsers.

On the other hand the Flash is a different and creative platform. If we check <a title="Statistics - Flash Use" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashruntimes/statistics.html" target="_blank">statistics of  the Flash</a> then we can say it might take a long to get off completely. But it is sure that people already has started using more HTML5 and JavaScript than to Flash.

&nbsp;
<h2>More Semantic, Accessibility and Clean Code</h2>
HTML5 is providing context related tags like <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">&lt;header&gt;</span> , <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">&lt;footer&gt;</span> , <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">&lt;article&gt;</span> , <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">&lt;section&gt;</span> , etc. which were not available in earlier version of HTML. This way HTML5 is more accessible if you want to add support to the screen readers. <a title="ARIA W3C Spec" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" target="_blank">ARIA</a> is W3C spec used to assign “roles” to elements.

SEO is one of the untold requirements for any web project today. Because if you launch a project on the web - the marketing is must. HTML5 has more SEO Semantic tags which are more friendly with search engines (i.e: Google, Yahoo, etc.).

HTML5 has new and clean code with categorized markup tags hierarchy which is understandable even without <em>CSS ID</em> or <em>CSS Class.</em>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;The Page Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
    The in-depth description about the topic.
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;
    &lt;img src=”img1.jpg” alt=”advertising block” title=”advertising block”/&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;/footer&gt;</pre>
&nbsp;
<h2>Mobile Development Approach</h2>
In the <a title="For the Future" href="#a" target="_blank">first section</a> we have talked about different frameworks developed using HTML5 as a markup base. One of them is the <a title="PhoneGap" href="http://phonegap.com/" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a>. It converts HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript in install-able apps for any device with Android, iOS or Windows phone.

So now developing mobile applications using front end development skill is quick and easy. And the best thing it will save time &amp; money too.

&nbsp;
<h2>The DOCTYPE</h2>
HTML5 has easy to remember <a title="DOCTYPE Definitions" href="https://www.totalvalidator.com/support/doctypes.html" target="_blank">document type definition</a> in comparison with earlier versions of HTML.
<pre>&lt; !DOCTYPE html&gt;
</pre>
&nbsp;
<h2>Offline Storage</h2>
Sometimes you have to face internet connectivity issues - at that time if you are in between of something, you have to lost the important data those has been filled up and repeat the entire process again.

To prevent such a situation HTML5 has added <em>offline storage</em> functionality. So if you lost connection that will hold up and waiting for connects again and mean while you can continue on what are you doing. <em>(i.e: Gmail email aaplication - prompt you text alert message in header while you lost connection)</em>.
<h2>Application Cache</h2>
<em>Application cache</em> is again powerful functionality to enhance performance of your application. The data (i.e.: CSS, JavaScript, Images) will store in your browser once and redirect from there first instead of server each time.

&nbsp;
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Yet HTML5 is not adopted completely but there is no harm to go with the trend. You should follow progressive enhancement approach and rock the world.
