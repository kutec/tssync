<div class="alert alert-danger">The BollywoddAPI.com seems down from so far! :(</div>
<blockquote><strong>Powerful RESTful APIs that allow you to retrieve all Bollywood-related information.</strong></blockquote>

Good news for developers and great thanks to&nbsp;<a title="Github - Tushar Soni" href="https://github.com/tusharsoni/" target="_blank"><strong>Tushar Soni</strong></a>&nbsp;who has developed <a title="Wikipedia - API" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">API</a> for <a title="Wikipedia - Bollywood" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood" target="_blank">Bollywood</a>.

Nowadays it is a big trend to keep latest Bollywood tracks in a pocket (smart phone). Everyone loves a music and big community in India follows Bollywood music.

Today we can search everything on <a title="Google :)" href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>. I have researched little and the results says - demand for Bollywood movie tracks has increased over the time. Below graph will prove my words. <em>(You may also try&nbsp;<a title="Google Trends" href="http://www.google.co.in/trends/" target="_blank">Google Trends</a>&nbsp;for specific keyword as well)</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2386 aligncenter" alt="Bollywood Keyword Search Graph" src="http://www.teckstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bollywood_search_graph.jpg" width="801" height="286" /></p>

I have taken "<strong>download bollywood song</strong>" as a keyword to show the trend in above statistical graph. And as you can see the it has been increasing with the years passes.

As an internet user, a music lover (<a title="Listen Tracks composed by Kushal Jayswal / KJAYZ / KU / KU.tec / kutec" href="https://soundcloud.com/kjayz" target="_blank">music composer</a> by passion) and a developer and I always want particular application or a website where I can simply go and search for a track or album to download.

I used some websites to download tracks free but all are loaded with bunch of unwanted advertisement and sometimes we cannot open them in a public place because of cheap pictures on them. I am sure that many of you must have faced such a situation.

<a title="Bollywood API" href="http://www.bollywoodapi.com/" target="_blank">Bollywodd API</a> provides&nbsp;Bollywood data for developers to create their own web services. They can sign-up on a website and have access through JSON integration.

<div class="alert alert-info">If you are with non-technical background you should aware of websites providing song/track downloading as a free, because they might be affected with virus or programmed to get your personal information (like username or password) or to shoot a program in to your operating system that might harm after a long time - so please <strong>be aware and do research before trust any website</strong></div>
