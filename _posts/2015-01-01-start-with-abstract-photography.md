Being a photographer that doesn't mean wedding or fashion photography. I love the nature and so my strength is <strong>candid photography</strong>. But while I start talking on this, people staring weirdly to me and I have to show them captured photographs to make them understood <em>(now this is something annoying to me)</em>.
<blockquote>Well! If we put aside "a career as a photographer", we can jump in to creative side of the photography. Previously I have written on <a title="Panoramic Photography" href="http://teckstack.com/panoramic-photography">Panoramic Photography</a> and today we will see one of the creative photography concept - the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract Photography</span>.</blockquote>
<h2>The word - Abstract</h2>
If you are a painter or Fine Art student, the word "abstract" may familiar to you. Abstract comes from Latin word "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">abstractus</span></strong>" - meaning <em>drawn away</em>. In English, abstract means to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">draw through the imaginations</span>. If you ask me, I would say everything in this world is abstraction only. Because imagination has no boundaries. If you can imagine and put it in physical way - called the abstraction to others.
<h2>Abstract Photography</h2>
In very simple term - "Painting a photograph called Abstract Photography". But here in little different way. Instead of a paint brush we have a light (to draw with), a set of DSLR camera and lance along with your imaginations.
<h2>Sharing Experience</h2>
As a photographer this is my first experience with abstract photography and might even a new subject for Indian photographers.

You need a dark background to start with your imagination.

[list icon="icon: arrow-right"]
<ul>
	<li>If you are shooting on a street (outdoor), there should be darken enough surrounding to your subject</li>
	<li>For indoor shoot, you can switch off all the lights (except your lighten subject)</li>
</ul>
[/list]
<h3>What is the Subject</h3>
For abstract photography, anything can be subject having light as a source. Because you have to draw your thoughts using a camera or we can say the <em><strong>light will be treated as a paint brush here</strong>, for your photograph</em>.
<h3>Strong Imaginations is the only Key</h3>
While trying with abstract art, your imagination must be strong enough to draw up physically as a photograph. This would your imagination only that come out with light abstraction. You need to be very precise to use a light to draw with. This needs a lot of patience and steady efforts. Techniques like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bulb mode</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">long exposure</span> would enhance the last output to the next level.
<h3>My Picture - My Thought</h3>
Attached image is an abstract art with help of smoke &amp; available lights in front of my camera. And <strong>without editing</strong>. It's a painful distortion of my bad memory. From the flow of happiness suddenly I found myself broken and ruined away. And I tried to show my pain in this picture.
<h3>Good or Bad</h3>
Something is precious to you, might nothing to someone else. No abstraction is bad because it'd full of emotions and thoughts. Some people keep up diary to express themselves. But as a photographer I found abstract photography is the best way to express emotions using camera and that is the only reason I love photography and my camera!!
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
To sum up, I would say it's completely up to you while trying with something really creative like - abstract photography. You have to stick with your imagination to put it to the world.

If you are a photographer, bring up with your imaginations and give a try. Please react on this post as a comment below to know more.
