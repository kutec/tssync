<blockquote>Any project launched today needs a marketing. Without marketing no business can survive. There is number of ways we can target large audience but the most effective medium we can consider is the web. Web marketing is cheaper, faster and more promising.</blockquote>

There are various strategies available for web marketing. One of them is a Search Engine Optimization (SEO). SEO has two strategies.

    <li><a title="Go to section - &quot;What is Offsite SEO&quot;" href="#What_is_Offsite_SEO"><strong>Offsite SEO</strong></a></li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

Web designer needs to understand Onsite SEO because it is core part of development. Offsite SEO is time-consuming for web designers and repetitive process. Generally web designers use to hire freelance SEO expert.

<h2>What is Onsite SEO</h2>

That doesn't matter which programming language (i.e.: PHP, Java) we use in back-end because finally everything on front end would render in HTML. Onsite SEO forces us to work on pages of a website. Search engines have their own algorithm to fetch newly created pages but it takes more time for indexing and gradually downgrades with the competitions.

<em>Home</em> or <em>Index</em> page is the mirror of the whole website. It should well-managed in context of content, images, tagline and colors too. If you follow <a title="Webmaster Guidelines  Best practices to help Google find, crawl, and index your site  Following these guidelines will help Google find, index, and rank your site. Even if you choose not to implement any of these suggestions, we strongly encourage you to pay very close attention to the &quot;Quality Guidelines,&quot; which outline some of the illicit practices that may lead to a site being removed entirely from the Google index or otherwise impacted by an algorithmic or manual spam action. If a site has been affected by a spam action, it may no longer show up in results on Google.com or on any of Google's partner sites.  Design and content guidelines Technical guidelines Quality guidelines When your site is ready:  Submit it to Google at http://www.google.com/submityourcontent/. Submit a Sitemap using Google Webmaster Tools. Google uses your Sitemap to learn about the structure of your site and to increase our coverage of your webpages. Make sure all the sites that should know about your pages are aware your site is online. Design and content guidelines" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en#design_and_content_guidelines" target="_blank">content guideline by Google</a> properly, it will help to rank up the page. There are number of meta tags help you for better indexing. Good headings tags (<span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;h1&gt;</span> to <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;h6&gt;</span>) always makes positive impact.

<h3>Required Checklist for Onsite SEO</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Heading Tags </strong>
Heading tags are created with the different priorities. Starting with <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">&lt;h1&gt;</span> as the most prioritize and <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;h6&gt;</span> as low prioritize heading of the page. It is important because search engine algorithms understand headings first then move to content. Further you should use <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;h1&gt;</span> tag only once because it refers the main title of the page. It tells search engines - "what's the page all about". So if you use <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;h1&gt;</span> multiple times might you wouldn't get desire result. On the other hand we should use <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">&lt;h2&gt;</span> tag multiple times to emphasize section on a page. You can follow the same for other headings too but keep priorities in mind.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML5 New Elements</strong><strong>
</strong>People has been started adopting HTML5 which comes with new elements like <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">&lt;header&gt;</span> ,<span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">&lt;nav&gt;</span> ,<span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;aside&gt;</span> ,<span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;section&gt;</span> ,<span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;article&gt;</span> ,<span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;footer&gt;</span> , etc. These new elements are more meaningful and SEO semantic. Search engines can easily recognized such tags and that would impact overall ranking.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Flow and Strategy</strong>
Easy to read content and impressive graphics would attract users. Content is an important context for rapid SEO. If you are writing an article you should use <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;article&gt;</span> and <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">&lt;section&gt;</span> tags for better readability of the code. Spaces and gaps would separate content properly and also looks good. You should learn how to write blogs that doesn't bore the reader. Deciding flow of writing would help in this case.</li>
    <li><strong>Section List
</strong>Creating links for different sections of the same article would help making content more readable. (You can see all articles on <a title="TeckStack.com" href="http://teckstack.com" target="_blank">this blog</a> following this rule.) And it is great to have index of the articles in a sidebar. Currently I have developed jQuery plugin for this functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility
</strong>Physically challenged people may use screen readers to access the web. Big and popular website should test properly for screen readers. Accessibility is not the matter for all websites but if we start understanding - it is so simple giving priorities as per content criteria using inline attributes while writing code. <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">role</span> is the common attribute, further all images should have <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">alt</span>  and <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">title</span>  attributes.</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<h2>What is Offsite SEO</h2>

After development we should think about faster marketing approaches and Offsite SEO is recommended by many professionals. In general - Offsite SEO includes number of activities like link building, blogging, forum posting, social media awareness, etc.. The only purpose of increasing traffic with suitable audience that may increase your profit.

As per my opinion, I found offsite activities time-consuming. I use to have a freelancer for such a purpose. This way you can concentrate more to development projects. Isn't it?
