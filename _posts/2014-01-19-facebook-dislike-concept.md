    Facebook is very user friendly and
    popular social networking website. But
    some users feels like it has been stereo
    type from so far and it definitely needs
    magic stick to compete with other social
    networking sites coming up in near
    future. One of the most awaited feature
    is Facebook Dislike.

If we compare Facebook few years back, we had other social networking sites too, but Facebook has won the match with simplicity and more enhanced user interface and keep them updated by the time.

But now social network has started to get devised into specifications. <a title="LinkedIn.com" href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="SkillPages.com" href="http://skillpages.com/" target="_blank">Skillpages</a> are the biggest example of professional social networks. They are very focused too.

Anyway, regular user of Facebook always <strong>like</strong> and <strong>share</strong> the content but usually they need another <em>event trigger</em> <em>for</em><strong><em> disliking</em></strong> the content, image, thoughts and the comment as well. Yes of course Facebook analysis what people demands. As per the <a title="Facebook dislike button for messenger" href="http://news.yahoo.com/facebook-dislike-button-finally-only-messenger-104500812.html" target="_blank">News</a> on <a title="Yahoo!" href="http://yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo!</a> FB has introduced "<strong>dislike</strong>" button but that is for <em>messenger only</em>.

Here if you can see the attached image, I have tried to composite "dislike" functionality with my thought with hope that Facebook would think on it and try to integrate for its users community.
