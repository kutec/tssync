post_excerpt: 'Usually we use Presentation Slide (i.e: PPT) to represent statistical reports to client. But somehow I found PPT very limited as far as space concern. We get limited and fixed-square space to showcase. If we place graph and numerical statistics on the same slide, we would get visually grunge result. And in genuine business, Report is main the key to success.'

I found new way "<strong>Google Drive</strong> - Smart way to represent Statistical Reports" through excel spread sheets.

<h3>Brief - Google Drive</h3>
<a title="Google Drive" href="http://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> is utility tool based on  cloud services from <a title="Google Inc." href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google Inc</a>. It is widely used because of big amount of free space provided and smooth document sharing availability. We can say online OFFICE. Creating &amp; Sharing all type of documents that we create using MS OFFICE, or OPENOFFICE is a great thing.

You should have <a title="Get GMAIL id" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/" target="_blank">GMAIL ID</a> to use GD service. Also you can <a title="Google Drive - Download" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive" target="_blank">download</a> the tool and install as utility to your <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/home" target="_blank">Windows</a> and <a title="MAC OS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS" target="_blank">Mac </a>operating system. Once installed, you will get folder named "Google Drive" on your desktop or specified location. And further you will get options added as a context menu of while exploring something into your OS.

With the use of GD (as an Admin) you can change / edit access to the file. You can choose accessibility of sharing.

Even you can publish the file on the wide internet. This feature inspired me to write this article that can enhance the way to represent statical reports for your company.

<h2><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span>Google Drive - File Publishing for the Web</h2>
[caption id="attachment_2072" align="alignright" width="170"]<img class="wp-image-2072 " title="GD" alt="google-drive-publish-to-the-web" src="http://www.teckstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/google-drive-publish-to-the-web.jpg" width="170" height="290" /> GD (figure 1.1)[/caption]
<ol>
	<li>Open some spread sheet file online</li>
	<li>Navigate to <strong>FILE</strong> menu</li>
	<li>Click on "<strong>Publish to the Web...</strong>"</li>
	<li>And now click on "<strong>Start Publishing</strong>" will allow your file visible with share entities (users).</li>
</ol>
You can choose users to give access for viewing and editing.
<h2>Let's start the magic now...</h2>
Following are the steps that helps you to meet our goal mentioned in YELLOW BOX above.
<ol>
	<li><strong> Create a New Folder</strong> somewhere in GD. (You need a new folder because we are going to share this folder for public access).</li>
	<li>Create a new HTML file (or <em></em><a title="Right Click to Download Sample File" href="http://demo.teckstack.com/files/gd-sample.html" target="_blank">download sample file</a>).</li>
	<li>Open specific file that you want to represent with your logo.</li>
	<li>Follow steps 1-4 described in above for "<strong>Google Drive - File Publishing for the Web</strong>".</li>
	<li>Select "<strong>HTML to embed in a page</strong>" as shown in GD (figure 1.2) and copy IFRAME code.</li>
	<li>Replace the IFRAME code and <em>change height and width to 100% </em>in sample file (this will make your sheet spread over the screen size of your browser window).</li>
</ol>
[caption id="attachment_2086" align="alignleft" width="315"]<img class="wp-image-2086 " title="GD (figure 1.2)" alt="google-drive-publish-to-the-web-iframe" src="http://www.teckstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/google-drive-publish-to-the-web-iframe.jpg" width="315" height="301" /> GD (figure 1.2)[/caption]

Few more steps you need to follow for URL purpose. If you have your own hosting space there is no problem you can map you domain to open INDEX.html by opening folder path. Inside folder you just need to put INXDEX.html file with iframe code will show the sheet.

&nbsp;
<h2>The Branding (placing Logo)</h2>
I have used default GD CSS in sample file. But you can write your own CSS and HTML.

<strong>HTML</strong> is just placing a IMG tag.
<pre>&lt;img src="http://www.teckstack.com/logo1.png" width="183px" height="31px" alt="TeckStack.com"&gt;</pre>
<strong>IFRAME (embedded code)</strong>
<pre>&lt;iframe width='500' height='300' frameborder='0' src='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AolQtcKU5grKdGYzYjRoVXJoV3BCX1YxSG1uX2k2bWc&amp;output=html&amp;widget=true'&gt;</pre>
<strong>CSS</strong>
<pre>#wrapper { 
    padding-top: 67px; 
}
.folder-overlay-header .folder-overlay-top-bar { 
    height: 65px !important; 
}
.folder-overlay-header {
    padding-left: 0 !important;
    text-align: center;
}
.folder-drive-logo { 
    position: relative; 
}</pre>
<em><strong>In the next article I will explain how you can host an INDEX file on GD itself and map over shorten URL.</strong></em>
