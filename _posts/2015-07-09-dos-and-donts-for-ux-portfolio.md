	<li><strong>Display your thought process and work approach
</strong>As a UX designer, you'll likely be judged by the kind of approach that you follow for handling multiple web design projects. Hence, while drafting your portfolio, do make it a point to describe your thought process that's associated with execution of every web design project that comes your way. Don't forget to include details about any competitive analysis or user research that you performed. Also, do demonstrate how well you understand the product/client requirements. For this, you may choose to show the wireframes that you may have sketched for any of your projects.
<strong>
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Demonstrate your ability to visualize things
</strong>Being a UX designer, it's quite essential for you to display your skills of visualizing things. You need to show how you pay special attention to every detail within the project and take care of the design so that it looks brilliant visually.
<strong>
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Demonstrate how good you are with solving complexities during UX designing process
</strong>It is vital to know that an individual who's looking out to hire a UX designer will opt for someone who has an ability of systematically figuring out the best way of solving the end user's problem. In addition to describing other pieces of work in the portfolio, don't forget to share a clear story about what the basic problem was and how effectively you went on to solving it in the best possible way.<strong>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Emphasizing quantity over quality</strong>
There are UX designers who opt for describing processes of multiple projects handled in the past. It is advised to choose only two or three projects and describe them in detail. Doing this will make sure that every word that you've mentioned within your portfolio speaks everything about your UX designing abilities.</li>
	<li><strong>Ignoring the visual showcase of your UX portfolio</strong>
In order to make your UX portfolio stand out from a crowd, it is advised not to ignore the visuals used within the same. Especially, if you're looking for a job in the UI/UX designing sector, it is vital to demonstrate your visual design skills in the best possible way.</li>
	<li><strong>Password protecting the UX portfolio</strong>More the count of viewers for your portfolio, more are your chances of getting shortlisted by potential employers. You must never go in for password protection of your UX portfolio as this will refrain visitors from knowing more about your work quality.</li>
</ol>
